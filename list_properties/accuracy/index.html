      <h1 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h1>
<p>A list may be entirely accurate or have some known errors, or have some elements where the provenance and accuracy are unknown.</p>
<p>For instance we would expect a list of numbers between 1 and 100 to be entirely accurate - because it would be trivial to ensure.</p>
<p>However a list of every postal address in a country is likely to be frequently inaccurate as new houses are built and other changes occur. This is particularly an issue for <strong>reality describing</strong> lists.</p>
<p>Some types of list contain pieces of information which can never really be entirely accurate, because they are opinion rather than facts. For instance, the shipping register contained assessments of underwriters about ships which were really some opinions about ships, and so could never be accurate in the same way as say, the recorded length of a ship.</p>
