      <h1 id="source-of-authority">Source of authority</h1>
<p>When we talk about lists which are complete and accurate (or even lists which are complete and accurate enough to use) we also talk about how we are able to make that assertion. There are various sources of that authority:</p>
<h2 id="a-priori">A priori</h2>
<p>Some lists are provably complete and accurate. For example a list of the first thousand prime numbers, could be proved to be complete by calculating those numbers and then looking to see if the register matched the list you had computed.</p>
<h2 id="verifiable-observation">Verifiable observation</h2>
<p>When the list contains things that have been observed in the world, it would be possible for someone else to recreate the list from scratch by conducting the same observations. For example, a list of member states of the European Union could be recreated by going to an authoritative source of that information and extracting a list.</p>
<h2 id="trusted-observation">Trusted Observation</h2>
<p>For some lists created by observing the world, re-observation, or verification is not possible. This is often because they take a snapshot of a point in time. For instance, while the school class attendance register can be validated at the time by a third party, a week later, it is impossible to verify that it is correct.</p>
<p>The authority of such lists depends on the amount of trust we have in whoever made the observation, and in the integrity of the processes for subsequently storing, retrieving and publishing the list.</p>
<h2 id="institutional-authority">Institutional authority</h2>
<p>The contents of the list are logically the responsibility of a single institution, and that institution is asserting that this list is complete and accurate. For instance, when Microsoft publishes a list of software that it provides support for, we believe this list to be complete because Microsoft is in a position to unilaterally decide the contents of the list and so can be trusted if they say this is a complete list.</p>
<h2 id="legislative-custodianship">Legislative custodianship</h2>
<p>The institution responsible for maintaining the list is doing so based on a statutory obligation. For instance, the register of UK political parties is maintained by the Electoral Commission due to their obligations in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (amongst others).</p>
<h2 id="best-known-effort">Best known effort</h2>
<p>Some lists are not complete or accurate, but are the best known effort to compile a complete list. In this case, their authority comes from there being no better list available. For instance Open Corporates claims to be the “largest database of companies in the world”.</p>
